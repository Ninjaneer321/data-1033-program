Department of Defense 1033 Program data
=================

This is a compilation of the raw data from the 1033 program that was released by the U.S. Department of Defenseâ€™s Defense Logistics Agency.

"This law allows transfer of excess Department of Defense property that might otherwise be destroyed to law enforcement agencies across the United States and its territories," according to the site.

The data is current as of September 30, 2015. The Washington Post will attempt to update the data if updates are posted online.

Data originally obtained from the [FOIA Reading Room] (http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/EFOIA-Privacy/Pages/ereadingroom.aspx#1033).

Notes:

According to the DoD, "Some of the items DLA transfers under the LESO program were purchased, in some cases, up to 50 years ago.  Therefore, the acquisition cost is the value of the item when it was last purchased."

The Washington Post added a "Cost" column, multiplying the cost per unit by the number of units in a transfer. The Post has not yet added this to the most recent data.

Lookup tables for demilitarization codes and demilitarization integrity codes are included and notes on demilitarization codes can be found here: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/demil/demil_codes.asp
